## Pitono

Pitono is a plugin that allows you to code in 11 different languages: Chinese, French, German, Indonesian, Japanese, Bengali, Dutch, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese. 

For example, instead of writing print in Spanish Python (aka Pitón) you can write imprimir. That way, non-English speakers can more easily understand Python and therefore will be more inclined to learn!
